# Example credentials file for ontap-mcp
# Store sensitive credentials separately from your main ontap.yml configuration

Pollers:
  # Production cluster credentials
  prod-cluster:
    username: prod-admin
    password: your-secure-password-here

  # Development cluster credentials
  dev-cluster:
    username: dev-admin
    password: your-dev-password-here

  # Test cluster credentials
  test-cluster:
    username: test-admin
    password: your-test-password-here

# Security recommendations:
# 1. Set restrictive permissions: chmod 600 this-file.yml
# 2. Add to .gitignore to prevent committing to version control
# 3. Store in a secure location outside the main config directory
# 4. Use environment-specific files: prod-creds.yml, dev-creds.yml
# 5. Consider using credentials_script for production environments

## ONTAP-MCP's Release and Support Lifecycle

ONTAP-MCP's current release schedule is quarterly in February, May, August, and November, but it may change at our discretion. 

Each release of ONTAP-MCP supports the most recently released version of ONTAP. We try our best to also support earlier versions of ONTAP. When that's not possible, breaking changes will be outlined in the changelog.

ONTAP-MCP is constantly being improved with new features and bug fixes. Customers are encouraged to upgrade frequently to take advantage of these improvements.

`We intend to support each ONTAP-MCP release for 12 months.`

For example, when `YY.MM` (ex: 26.02) is released, we intend to support it until `YY+1.MM` (ex: 27.02) is released. At the same time, `YY-1.MM` (ex: 25.02) and associated minor releases (ex: 25.02.1) move to limited or no support.

If you are running a version of ONTAP-MCP that’s more than 12 months old, you must upgrade to a newer version to receive support from NetApp. We always recommend running the latest version.

We use GitHub for tracking [bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/NetApp/ontap-mcp/issues).
